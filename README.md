# cESFW_Embryo_Topology_Paper
In this repository we provide the code to reproduce the results in our manuscript (add hyperlink here).

## cESFW software package
The research in our manuscript focusses on introducing our continuous entropy sort feature weighting (cESFW) software. This package can be downloaded and installed from https://github.com/aradley/cESFW

## Data repository
The synthetic data and human embryo data required to reproduce the results in our manuscript and run the workflow provided in the following Mendeley Data repository can be found at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/34td4ds2r9/draft?a=c464ae1c-08a6-430a-8bb2-6dc8146d61f5

## Synthetic data workflows
Each of the 4 synthetic datasets used in our manuscript can be reproduced by going to the synthetic dataset folder of interest and following the data generation workflows which are written in R. For example, after downloading the above Mendeley Data repository, navigate to the Synthetic_Data folder and then select one of the 4 sub-directories. Within these, the file name starting with "Dyngen_Create" will allow the user to create the synthetic dataset from scratch in R, and the file name ending with "workflow" will allow the user to analyse the data in Python.
